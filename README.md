# Azure Transit VNet with the VM-Series

The Azure Transit VNet with the VM-Series deploys a hub and spoke architecture to centralize commonly used services such as security and secure connectivity. All traffic to and from the Spokes will “transit” the Hub VNet and will be protected by the VM-Series next generation firewall. To get started, the Hub VNet must be deployed first with the Spoke VNets being deployed subsequently. Once the Spoke is deployed, the VNets are dynamically peered to allow cross VNet communication. For more information on deployment please see the [Deployment Guide](https://github.com/jpeezus/TransitVNet1.0/blob/master/documentation/Azure_Transit_VNet0.1_Deployment_Guide.pdf).


# Hub VNet
The Hub VNet is deployed exclusively to handle outbound traffic that originates from within the Hub or Spoke VNet. This outbound work flow not only segments traffic that originates from outside of the VNet, but it also ensures that only whitelisted external requests are allowed by leveraging VM-Series security policies. By providing a single exit point for traffic originating within your VNets you can ensure that all outbound traffic is secured to the standards required by your organization. 

This topology consists of
- 2 VM-Series Firewalls
- 1 Standard Outbound Load Balancer

# Spoke VNet
Using the Spoke VNet template, you can deploy as many Spokes as needed to host internal only, or public facing workloads. Return traffic from inbound web access requests will traverse the same path it was received, and traffic originating from the Hub and Spoke networks will exit the hub VNet exclusively.

This topology consists of
- 1 Application Gateway functioning as an external load balancer listening on port 80. 
- Spoke subnets 192.168.0.0/21, 192.168.8.0/21 and so on.
- 2 VM-Series Firewalls [Optional]
- 1 Internal Loadbalancer
- 2 Linux Web servers
- 1 UDR sending all default route traffic to the Hub vnet Standard Load Balancer.
