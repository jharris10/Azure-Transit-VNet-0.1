# Azure Transit VNet with the VM-Series

- Now supports bootstrapping in both Hub and Spoke 
- Now supports Virtual Machine Scale Sets in the Spoke
- For more info on the first release of Azure Transit VNet please see the Azure Transit VNet [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/Azure-Transit-VNet).


The Azure Transit VNet with the VM-Series deploys a hub and spoke architecture to centralize commonly used services such as security and secure connectivity. All traffic to and from the Spokes will “transit” the Hub VNet and will be protected by the VM-Series next generation firewall. To get started, the Hub VNet must be deployed first with the Spoke VNets being deployed subsequently. Once the Spoke is deployed, the VNets are dynamically peered to allow cross VNet communication. For more information on deployment please see the [Deployment Guide](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/Azure-Transit-VNet-0.1/blob/master/documentation/Azure_Transit_VNet0.1_Deployment_Guide.pdf).


# Hub VNet
The Hub VNet is deployed exclusively to handle outbound traffic that originates from within the Hub or Spoke VNet. This outbound work flow not only segments traffic that originates from outside of the VNet, but it also ensures that only whitelisted external requests are allowed by leveraging VM-Series security policies. By providing a single exit point for traffic originating within your VNets you can ensure that all outbound traffic is secured to the standards required by your organization. 

This topology consists of
-	2 VM-Series Firewalls
-	1 Standard internal Load Balancer
-	Linux Worker Node
	-	Worker node uses the Tabular storage table to keep track of the Azure VMSS table and Panorama device list. During a scale down 	event the worker node will deactivate the license in the Support Portal and remove the firewall from Panorama. 
	-	The worker node updates the NAT address object in the Spoke VM-series with the correct IP address of the spoke ILB. 
	-	The worker node will add the Azure instrumentation key for application insights into the Panorama template for reach new spoke deployment. 
-	1 Tabular Storage Table
	-	Stores VMSS device list data

# Spoke VNet
Using the Spoke VNet template, you can deploy as many Spokes as needed to host internal only, or public facing workloads. Return traffic from inbound web access requests will traverse the same path it was received, and traffic originating from the Hub and Spoke networks will exit the hub VNet exclusively.

This topology consists of
-	1 Application Gateway functioning as an external load balancer listening on port 80. 
-	Spoke subnets are 192.168.0.0/21 Spoke1, 192.168.8.0/21 Spoke2 and so on.
-	Virtual Machine Scale Set with a VM-Series
-	Availability Set for VM-Series
-	1 Internal Load Balancer
-	2 Linux Web servers
-	1 UDR sending all default route traffic to the Hub VNet Standard Load Balancer.

-	1 Bastion host
	-	Used to connect to VM-Series firewalls in the VMSS via private Mgmt interface IP
-	Application insights
	-	Used to process VM-Series metrics used to determine scale in & scale out events
